How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Keep your code simple, write comments often, execute often, and pay attention to all of the compiler warnings. 
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The requirement gathering phase of the software development process is very critical, this is where you get the opportunity to ask the user/customer
needs so pay attention, write everything down and put yourself in the position of that user.
If you are necessarily developing something scratch but possibly creating enhancements for the system, think of scenarios where certain functionalities
could be more user friendly and ensure that testing covers at least 80% of scenarios to ensure that the user has a positive experience once those enhancements
hit the production environment.
How do I approach designing software?
From a functional and a non-functional perspective. Putting the users needs first when creating a design but also making sure that what you are designing actually
makes sense, as well as ensuring that everything works as it should by completing extensive testing.
